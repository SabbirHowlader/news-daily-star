        <p class="font-xxl font-weight-bold">1. what is the difference between var let and const?</p>
        <p class="text-primary">Ans: Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.Just like  var, let declarations are hoisted to the top. Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error. Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>

        <p class="font-xxl font-weight-bold">2. What is the difference between foreach and map and filter in javascript?</p>
        <p class="text-primary">Ans:The main difference between this two methods is that forEach allows you to change elements of original array and returns undefined and map does not allow you to change original array and intended for making new array based on original one.The main difference between map and forEach is that the map method returns a new array by applying the callback function on each element of an array, while the forEach method doesn't return anything. You can use the forEach method to mutate the source array, but this isn't really the way it's meant to be used.</p>

        <p>3. What is difference between arrow function and normal function?</p>
        <p class="text-primary">Ans: Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>

        <p>4. why use templateing?</p>
        <p  class="text-primary">Ans: Templates increase flexibility: Templates actually increase flexibility, they're easy to update, and they provide consistency across the project. They can be improved regularly to meet technological and instructional requirements as well as the client's needs. These are easily tracked and updated.</p>
